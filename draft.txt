1. setup proper security measures
2. setup proper scalability measures

- gist allows users to gist with hashtags.
An example - "Jerry@unn.ng" dropped a hot gist about ebonyi girls"

- gist allows users to register under one campus.

- gist has campus live gist where all messages disappear after 24 hours. (like a group chat for all members of the campus)

- two types of posts, an **update** and a **gist**. An update lasts as long as the author does not delete it, a gist last 24hours and has a live chat where people can talk about the gist going on.

- allow for an update or a gist to be public or only visible to a campus, even if it is visible to other campuses,they can't join in the live chat

- video(s) - not longer than 1 minute, picture(s) and text - not longer than 300 characters

- each account has level of popularity in each campuses which is based on: account with most activity ratio, likes and re-gists.

- Remember! don't delete an uodate but hide it, will be needed for analysis for most popular gist account.

use a secondary db to store user session, these includes the device details {
device_id (mac addresss / IMEI for mobile)
session_token for each device
ip_address
time_zone
device_model
app_version
last_active_time
}
CREATE TABLE user_devices (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    account_id INT REFERENCES users(id),
    device_id VARCHAR(100),         -- Unique identifier for the device
    device_type VARCHAR(50),        -- e.g., 'iPhone', 'Android', 'Web'
    device_os VARCHAR(50),          -- e.g., 'iOS', 'Android'
    app_version VARCHAR(20),        -- Version of the app installed on the device
    time_zone VARCHAR(50),
    session_token TEXT,
    ip_address VARCHAR(45),         -- IP address of the device connection
    last_active TIMESTAMP,          -- Last time the device was active
    login_time TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,  -- Time the device logged in
    is_revoked BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,  -- Whether the device is revoked
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

encrypt ip_address with a private/publickey system

# use postgreSQL for gists, accounts, media, campuses, popularity, subscriptions, reports, moderator

Use elixir/go for the chat service with mongo or cassandra

Setup a secondary db for storing temp data like active status ('away', 'active')
